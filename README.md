# PuyoTest
This is a prototype/test/playground/toy project i've created out of curiosity to  discover how to create a game like puyo-puyo, and also see how difficult it would be to create a super nice chain in the game. This was not supposed to be a pretty copy of my work. This is literally just a bunch of code i wrote to 
test stuff.

I really want to implement a monte carlo search algorithm to generate efficient chains, instead of this crappy brute-force code implemented right now and i eventually will when i finish my college stuff. I dont plan to implement it using python in the future though (\*cough\* slow af \*cough\*). Maybe using the beloved Godot Engine? who knows :) (sure i will. i love you Godot <3)
